Some cameras (such as the Nikon D1X) have rectangular instead of the usual square sensor cells. Without correction this would lead to distorted images. This module applies the needed scaling.

_darktable_ detects images that need correction by their Exif data and automatically activates this module where required. For other images the module always remains disabled. 

The module has no controls.
