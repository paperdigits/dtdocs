Enhance image saturation. This module will affect pixels with low saturation more than pixels with high saturation. **N.B. I've changed this from the manual, which currently states that velvia effects _high-saturation_ pixels more. Please can someone confirm.**

## Module Controls

strength
: The strength of the effect

mid-tones bias
: Reduce the effect on mid-tones in order to avoid unnatural skin tones. Reducing the mid-tone bias reduces mid-tone protection and makes the overall velvia effect stronger.
