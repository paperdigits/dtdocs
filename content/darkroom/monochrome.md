Quickly convert an image to black & white using a variable color filter.

Under certain conditions, especially highly saturated blue light sources in the frame, this module may produce black pixel artifacts. See the gamut clipping option of the _input color profile_ module on how to mitigate this issue.

_Tip: First reduce the filter size to concentrate its effect and move it across the hue pallet to find the best filter value for your desired image rendition. Then expand the filter to include more hues and thus more natural tonality._

## Module Controls

filter size/position
: The default central location of the filter has a neutral effect but dragging it to an alternate position applies a filter analogously to taking a b&w photograph through a conventional color filter.

: A color picker can be activated to automatically set the position and size of the filter. Change the filter size by scrolling with the mouse wheel. This makes the filter's range of hues more or less selective.

highlights
: Control how much to keep highlights.
